Talking about patching vulnerabilities publicly on GitHub is one of the main ways that attackers find and exploit vulnerabilities
in Open Source software.  This is a short guide on how to handle the process properly, using the Log4Shell incident as a case study.

### Things they don't teach you in school

As a "normal" developer who works alongside security engineers, I hear them mention all kinds of best practices that,
for the most part, I've never heard of.  It turns out that how to properly deal with vulnerabilities in a project you use or contribute to,
right down to what you say on GitHub, can be just as important as getting the vulnerability patched.log4j is a great case study because,
even though people had the best intentions, things went catastrophically wrong.

At the core of the issue you have a couple of
developers donating their spare time, doing their best. This is absolutely not
meant to be a hit piece against them or Open Source software, but instead a guide to help the next person handle things the right way.
Together, let's learn how to do this properly.

### Hackers are crawling GitHub looking for security patches

Patching vulnerabilities is great, and finding one and contributing a fix can be pretty exciting. But for a vulnerability to be patched,
one has to have first existed.  It's trivially easy to write a webcrawler that looks through GitHub for the words "vulnerability", "security", "injection", etc...
and find a package where the last version, if not the current one, has a vulnerability ready to be turned into an exploit.
Those crawlers are up and running right now, reading your comments and looking for the next 0-day. Let that sink in.

## It's about being discreet

### Reporting the vuln

How the vulnerability first gets reported is critical. In the case of log4j, contrary to what you might think,
it looks like everything went right.  The log4j team was contacted **privately** about the vulnerability.  If you are
someone spotting a vulnerability for the first time, this is exactly what you should do.

INSERT EXPLANATION OF HOW IT WENT DOWN

Allow a reasonable amount of time
for them to deal with the issue before you do anything public on GitHub.

### Patching the vuln

Discretion is key here. Web crawlers aren't smart enough to recognize that a patch fixes a vulnerability
without anyone saying it out-loud.  If they were, we'd be in trouble.
